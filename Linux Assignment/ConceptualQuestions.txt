1.​ What is the difference between Linux and Unix?​
- Unix requires a paid commercial license to use whereas Linux is open source and free to use and modify.
- Unix requires specific hardware to use. Linux can run on almost every hardware.
- Unix most often comes with command line interface and a GUI is uncommon. Linux has number of GUI to choose from (Gnome in debian).


2.​ Explain the Linux file system hierarchy with examples.
- Linux file system is similar to a tree data structure where there is one parent node and all other nodes branches out from it. In case of Linux the parent node is /root directory. All other files and directories are stored inside the root directory (/home, /etc, /bin). All User directories are stored inside the /home directory.


3.​ What are absolute and relative paths in Linux?
- Absolute path: Path of a file/directory from the root directory (cd /home/dhairyasen/Documents)
- Relative path: Path of the directory/file from the current directory. Lets say there was a folder inside Documents called Notes. (cd Notes)

4.​ What does each field in -rw-r--r-- mean?​
- These are the permissions given to the Owner,group and others of the file respectively.
- Indications of each field:
	-	Type of file: 		simple file
	rw-	Permission of owner:	read and write
	r--	Permission of group	read
	r--	Permission of others	read


5.​ What is the significance of the first character in ls -l output?
- Let's consider this as an example output:
	-rw-r--r-- 1 dhairyasen dhairyasen 84423 Aug 15 17:31 'Linux Assignment.pdf'
	drwxr-xr-x 2 dhairyasen dhairyasen  4096 Aug 15 19:43 'Section A'
	drwxr-xr-x 2 dhairyasen dhairyasen  4096 Aug 15 19:11 'Section B'
- Where the first column "drwxr-xr-x" shows the permission of the file the very first character tells about the type of file or directory.
- Example: "-" says it is a normal file. "d" says that it is directory.


6.​ Define the roles of owner, group, and others in Linux permissions.
- Owners are the one that creates the files and have full control over it.Owner has the permission to read, write and execute files. (rwx)
- Group are collective users set in a group that have shared access to the files created by the owner. Group has the permission to read and execute files. (r-x)
- Everyone else in the system who are neither the user nor belong to any group. Others have the permission to only read files. (r--)


7.​ What is the difference between chmod 755 and chmod 700?
- chmod is used to change the permissions of existing files.chmod numbers are digits that represent permissions for Owner, Groups and Others respectively.
- Read(4), Write(2), Execute(1)
- Therefore the numbers signify these permissions respectively:
	chmod 755:
		7:	[Owner] -> r(4) + w(2) + x(1) = rwx
		5:	[Group] -> r(4) + x(1) = r-x
		5:	[Others -> r(4) + x(1) = r-x
	
	chmod 700:
		7:	[Owner] -> r(4) + w(2) + x(1) = rwx
		0:	[Group] -> 0 = -
		0:	[Others -> 0 = -
	

8.​ How is a symbolic link different from a hard link?​
- Symbolic link also called as soft link, only creates a shortcut of the original file and is left dangling if the original file is deleted. It type file becomes -l and it is able to point paths to directories unlike hard link.

9.​ What is the purpose of umask?
- Umask is used to change the default permissions of the files when they are created.
- Syntax: 
	umask octal_numbers



10.​What are the default permissions of a new file created by touch?
- We can see that when we run umask in bash that the permissions ommit 022.
- Meaning the permissions are 644 (rwxr--r--) that is Read write and execute for owner, read for group and others.


11.​What is the function of grep and how is it used in log analysis?​
- Grep function is used to search and locate a specific text or pattern in files.
- Its use in log analysis is to monitor errors and track user activities and track errors.


12.​How does cut differ from awk?
- cut: Cut is used to extract specific columns or text from a file based on some delimiters. Its is fast and simple. But cannot perform complex operations.
- awk: Is slight slower than cut but it is very complex and supports full scripting. Filtering, Modifying, Calculations etc


13.​What is the use of the find command? Give syntax.​
- Find command is used to find a specific file in your system.
- Syntax:
	$ find /directory -name filename.extension
	$ find /directory -type file_type -name filename


14.​How does sed handle file editing?​
- sed is a text editing tool in Linux.
- It reads the text line by line, applies command on each line and outputs to standard output by default.
- sed is non-interactive and can automate repetitive text editing, making it very useful in log processing, configuration updates, and scripting.


15.​What’s the difference between df -h and du -sh?
- df -h: Shows the free and used storage details of the filesystem and partitions.
- du -sh: Shows the storage of a specific directory.


16.​What is the use of ps, top, and htop?
- ps: Displays the information about a selection of the active processes.
- top: Displays real time view of the running system. Displays system summary as well as threads and processes currently being managed by the kernel.
- htop: Similar to top but more interactive and colorful.


17.​Explain how cron is used for scheduling in Linux.​
- cron runs in the background as a daemon and checks the crontab for any scheduled tasks.
- cron tab is where the tasks are assigned for scheduling. Specific details for scheduling can be assigned like time, date etc.
- cron runs tasks repeatedly and is not best if you want to schedule task only once.

19.​What does the pipe | operator do in Linux?​
- Pipe | is used to run multiple commands at once. This is mostly used for controlling stdin and stdout. Most likely used to store outputs elsewhere or opening a command output in separate window.
